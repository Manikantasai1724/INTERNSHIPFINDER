🟥 Problem Statement 

Many students struggle to find suitable internships because opportunities are scattered across various platforms like Internshala, LinkedIn, Telegram groups, and college notices. Searching manually is time-consuming, and students often end up applying for positions that do not match their skills or career goals. As a result, many valuable opportunities are missed, especially for first-year and second-year students who are still exploring their strengths.
There is a need for an automated system that can analyze a student's skills and recommend relevant internships efficiently.

🟩 Solution Description 

The proposed solution is AI Internship Finder, an AI-powered web system where students simply upload their resume, and the system automatically analyzes their skills using AI. Based on the extracted skill set, the system searches Internshala for matching internships and returns a clean list of recommended opportunities along with direct “Apply Now” links.
This eliminates the need for manual searching, ensures better skill-matching, and makes the internship application process faster and smarter.
The system is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, n8n for automation, OpenAI for resume intelligence, and Internshala as the internship source.
